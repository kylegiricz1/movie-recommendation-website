# movie-recommendation-website
This website uses genre and rating preferences to recommend a movie.

# To run our program:
You need to run both the back-end and the front-end at the same time (so 2 different terminals).

For the front-end (React):
- Open a terminal and go to the front-end folder. Run `npm install` (to install all required libraries) and then `npm start` (to start the front-end)

For the back-end (Flask):
- Open another terminal and go to the back-end folder. Run `pip install flask`, `pip install flask_cors`, and 'brew install postgresql@15' to install all required libraries. Then run `python backend.py`.

Then go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the webpage.

Thanks,
John
